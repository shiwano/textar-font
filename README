Textar Font ver.0.1

Textar Font is a japanese propotional font,
derived from the IPA PGothic font ver.3.02.
It aims to represent Shift_JIS art graphics properly,
almost all of which require the MS PGothic font.

WHAT'S "textar-min.**"?
  It includes minimal Kanji glyphs to reduce the file size.
  specifically, the first level Kanji and the second level Kanji only
  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS_X_0208).
